996能否减少不平等？
996指的是每天早上九点上班晚上九点下班每周工作六天。
全球总财富为$454.8 trillion，人口为540 million，富人占比13.1%，控制全球财富的85.2%，穷人占比86.9%，控制全球财富的14.8%（Global Wealth Report, 2023）。
劳动收入计算规则如下，在八小时工作时间内，收入=Q(t)*p，Q(t)是生产函数，根据边际递减规律，它是递减的。p是每单位劳动所获得的价格，全球平均工资为$9,733 per year(Jack Flynn, 2023)，在八小时工作时间外，也就是工作日加班4小时，周末加班12小时，不考虑中途吃饭去卫生间等时间消耗，加班过程中，每单位劳动所获得的价格变为原来的1.5倍。
资本收入计算规则如下，如果存入银行，每年利率为1%。如果用于投资，10%的概率资本翻倍，50%的概率资本不变，40%的概率资本减少20%.富人中有60%的人愿意投资而40%愿意储蓄，且富人中有0.01%的人愿意996，其余人是八小时工作制。穷人全部996，挣的钱全部用于储蓄。


Can 996 reduce inequality? 

996 refers to working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. The global total wealth is $454.8 trillion with a population of 540 million. The rich make up 13.1% of the population and control 85.2% of the global wealth, while the poor make up 86.9% of the population and control 14.8% of the global wealth (Global Wealth Report, 2023).

The labor income calculation rule is as follows: within an eight-hour workday, income = Q(t) * p, where Q(t) is the production function and decreases according to the law of diminishing marginal returns. p is the price per unit of labor, and the global average wage is $9,733 per year (Jack Flynn, 2023). During overtime, which is four hours on workdays and 12 hours on weekends, the price per unit of labor increases by 1.5 times.

The capital income calculation rule is as follows: If deposited in a bank, the annual interest rate is 1%. If invested, there is a 10% chance of doubling the capital, a 50% chance of not changing, and a 40% chance of decreasing the capital by 20%. 60% of the rich are willing to invest while 40% prefer to save, and only 0.01% of the rich are willing to work under the 996 system, while the rest work eight hours a day. All poor people work under the 996 system and save all their earnings.
